# vite-demo

Trying some Three.js and TypeScript

# Initial setup

Based on https://www.youtufbe.com/watch?v=p4BHphMBlFA 

* Create a new repo on GitHub with a LICENSE file (to make the repo non-empty)
* npm i -g npm@latest
* npm install -g vite@latest
* cd \git
* git clone https://github.com/dominicprior/vite-demo
* cd vite-demo
* npm init vite@latest .   (I used a cmd.exe because this command didn't display its options properly in a git bash prompt)
  * ignore files and continue
  * vanilla
  * typeScript
* npm install
* (I didn't do "npm install three" since I want local stuff I can edit)
* npm run dev (from the VSCode terminal)  -  it launched the localhost server that showed the Vite demo webpage
